Graphical User Interface for creating NUFEB simulation configurations

NUFEB (Newcastle University Frontier in Engineering Biology) is an open source tool for 3D agent-based simulation of microbial systems. The tool is built on top of the molecular dynamic simulator LAMMPS, and extended with features for microbial modelling. As part of this legacy, the inputs to NUFEB are rooted in terms more familiar to molecular dynamics simulations.

Nufeb-designer is a graphical user interface frontend which enables creating NUFEB configurations, including initial organism layouts, at a high level of abstraction and  without needing to understand the configuration language.

Development was funded by the USF NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology Award #2007151.

Because nufebmgr is under active development and experimental, we would like you contact us if you use it. We'd enjoy hearing about how we could make it better AND we'd like to have a list of people to contact if major bugs are found. The best person to contact at this time would be Joseph E. Weaver: joe.weaver@newcastle.ac.uk
